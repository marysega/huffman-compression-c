# Huffman Compression (C)

Implementation of Huffman coding in C: compress and decompress files using a frequency-based binary tree encoding.

## What this project demonstrates
- Data compression fundamentals (Huffman coding)
- Trees / priority queues concepts
- File I/O and binary formats
- Clean build process with Makefile

## Tech
C • Linux • Makefile • Git

## Structure
- `src/` : source code
- `include/` : headers
- `test_files/` : sample files for testing

  ## Write-ups
- [Huffman explained](writeups/huffman-explained.md)
- [Frequency attack note](writeups/frequency-attack.md)


## Build & run
```bash
make
./bin/huffman
